Hi Prof! It may be a little late but here's my reflection for the guest lecture.

Reflection on Industry Practices

The guest lecture was interesting to see all the technical details that were at play for the dash robot. 
Seeing the development and integration of 3d imaging technology into a machine learning algorithm to allow 
for a robot to navigate the real world is enlightening as to how different technologies can work together. 
While the presentation gave us insight as to the technologies used that enabled the project, the question and 
answer section helped to give more insight into the software engineering part of the project.Â 

It was interesting to see that the speaker had a much higher level view of the software engineering aspect of 
the project when compared to the things that we learned in the module. He would talk about most of the things 
we learnt in the module as concepts in his own words as compared to the specific terms we learnt. It was even 
more interesting when he talked about how the things that we did such as the SRS, are more for higher level products. 
However, the contents of an SRS are definitely always considered like system architecture, etc, just not 
in an extremely formal way, and is always changing and updated as the development continues.
